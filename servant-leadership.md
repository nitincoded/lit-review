# Servant Leadership

Berger, Travis A. (Fall 2014). Servant Leadership 2.0: A Call for Strong Theory. Sociological Viewpoints. 30(1). 146-167.  
Berger introduces the topic by citing the need for servant leadership - fixing the organizational climate after major corporate scandals. There is no consensus on the definition of servant leadership. Robert Greenleaf coined the term in 1977. Berger draws upon Van Dierendonck's review of literature in 2011 {"Van Dierendonck (2011) identified servant leadership as a possible solution to the paucity of ethics in the business community and as a potential tool by which to increase employee engagement"}. Larry Spears, who spent time with Robert Greenleaf, defined the 10 characteristics of a servant leader. Other works (Barbuto & Wheeler, 2006; Sendjaya, Sarros & Santora, 2008; Patterson, 2004; Spencer, 2007; Liden, Wayne, Zhao & Henderson, 2008; Russell & Stone, 2002; Page & Wong, 2000; Dennis & Winston, 2003; Wong & Davey, 2007; Laub, 2000 & 2003) also identify characteristics of servant leadership. Reviews of servant leadership literature by Van Dierendonck, Dierendonck& Powers were cited.
