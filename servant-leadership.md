# Servant Leadership

Berger, Travis A. (Fall 2014). Servant Leadership 2.0: A Call for Strong Theory. Sociological Viewpoints. 30(1). 146-167.  
Berger introduces the topic by citing the need for servant leadership - fixing the organizational climate after major corporate scandals. There is no consensus on the definition of servant leadership. Robert Greenleaf coined the term in 1977. Berger draws upon Van Dierendonck's review of literature in 2011 {"Van Dierendonck (2011) identified servant leadership as a possible solution to the paucity of ethics in the business community and as a potential tool by which to increase employee engagement"}. Larry Spears, who spent time with Robert Greenleaf, defined the 10 characteristics of a servant leader. Other works (Barbuto & Wheeler, 2006; Sendjaya, Sarros & Santora, 2008; Patterson, 2004; Spencer, 2007; Liden, Wayne, Zhao & Henderson, 2008; Russell & Stone, 2002; Page & Wong, 2000; Dennis & Winston, 2003; Wong & Davey, 2007; Laub, 2000 & 2003) also identify characteristics of servant leadership. Reviews of servant leadership literature by Van Dierendonck, Dierendonck& Powers were cited.

Cater, John James III. (Oct 2015). Servant Leadership in Multigenerational Family Firms. Journal of Applied Management and Entrepreneurship. 20(4). 25-48.  
We used the Organizational Leadership Assessment (OLA) (Laub, 1999) to determine if servant leadership was practiced in respondent firms and then employed a qualitative case study approach consisting of in-depth, semistructured interviews to compare servant-led and non-servant-led firms. We outline six important areas for the understanding of servant leadership in family firms. The benefits to family firm leaders who successfully implement servant leadership may include respectful, agreeable, and highly motivated employees as well as increased sustainability of their organizations for future generations of family members. {From Abstract}

The paper describes 6 types of servant leadership (putting people first, ethical behavior, morals, conceptual skills, humility, building relationship) and 3 extensions (dutiful, devotion, listening) to servant leadership found in China. Confucianism, Daoism, and Communist Ideology are also compared to servant leadership.
